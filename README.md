## Project 

I like R. 
I live in Berlin and most of the data science job offering require primary knowledge of python. Why? Everybody believes python is faster and more programmer-friendly. 

But the job of a data scientist encompasses 3 big areas:

* Data exploration
* Statistical Modeling
* Deployment

While I can see an advantage in using python for deployment (well, actually there is [Plumber](https://github.com/trestletech/plumber) for R), I hypothise that data exploration and visualization in much more enjoyable in R.

In this repository I want to replicate all the notebooks that [Nolan Conaway](https://github.com/nolanbconaway/pitchfork-data) has analyzed and the benchmark the speed of each script on my local machine. 
Let's find out.
